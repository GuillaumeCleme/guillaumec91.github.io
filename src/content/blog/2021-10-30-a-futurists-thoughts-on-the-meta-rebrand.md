# Futuristic thoughts on the Meta rebrand (Facebook)

Let's start with Facebook as we know it. As an "edler millenial" there is something strange about being the last generation that lived before social media. Facebook used to be where the "cool kids" hung out (right after MSN Messenger lost it's top spot and after everyone grew tired of making their own websites using Piczo). For years, Facebook was _the_ social media platform. Fast forward a few years later and Facebook a place full of ads, mis-information, and your aunt sharing cat memes. With [2.85 billion monthly users](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx), Facebook is definitely still an active platform. With the largest demographics being made up of [25-34 year olds](https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/), elder millenials make up the largest user group. Having lost a lot of traction with the "cool kids", and with the all the buzz around Web 3.0 I think now is a good time for Facebook to think about a rebrand.

## What is Web 3.0?
Altough this topic alone could be the subject of an entire article (coming soon), here's a quick brief:

* **Web 1.0:** Static desktop web pages designed for information consumption. Usually served from a costly self-managed architecture.
* **Web 2.0:** Mobile first, interactive experiences, and user-generated content that brought us the web sites and applications we use today. Includes the rise of cloud computing, big data, and the generalization of APIs.
* **Web 3.0:** Open, trustless and permissionless networks spreading the data from data centers out to the edge (perhaps even personal devices). Widespread use of AI and Blockchain as a means of interaction and exchange.  

Today we are still in the Web 2.0 era and still dealing with all of the unfortunate side effects of that time which give social media platforms (especially Facebook) a bad name. With most internet companies as we know them becoming what they are today during the Web 2.0 period, a number of them had to come up with monetizations strategies to keep growing. Unfortunately for us end users visting free websites where financial transactions usually do not occur, that meant monetizing something else; **our data**.

This brings us to where Facebook is now. A company no one trusts, that uses your data as a currency, is full of ads, and that the younger generations doesn't care much for. So how can they change this? 

## The Meta rebrand

There's no doubt about it the Facebook name hasn't aged very well but they are going to need much more than a rebrand to fix that. Here's where this gets interesting. We now know that the Meta name is to align the company to the vision of a Metaverse. So what is a Metaverse? Let's start by defining a term we are more familiar with, the universe. The universe can be described as all existing matter and space considered as a whole. The term meta also denotes something of a higher or second-order kind. A metaverse could then be described as a "second universe".

> Universe: all existing matter and space considered as a whole.

Thinking about Web 3.0 technologies and about the technologies that Facebook already owns such as [Oculus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2014/03/25/facebook-buys-oculus-virtual-reality-gaming-startup-for-2-billion/?sh=5200855c2498), it's easy to see how they could now create a digital universe and likely be the first ones to do it. For that to happen though, they need to detach themselves from the Facebook brand and reinvent themselves as a new company. 

## What are we going to do in the Metaverse?

### Communicate
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, remote work is here to stay. Altough there are many benefits to remote work, we've now come up with new terms such as Zoom-fatigue to also define the negative aspects of remote work. Some say that the cognitive load caused by the constant focus of a video camera and the challenges of one-way audio are to blame but one thing is certain, we now rely on technology more than ever to communicate. With that said it is still hard to replace face to face interactions with today's tools. In a virtual world such as the Metaverse, it may be easier to create virtual environments where groups can gather but where side conversations can still occur by virtualy distancing yourself from others. This would allow us to reinvent the "breakout rooms" we've come to know for both personal and professional contexts. With offerings like Portal and Workplace, Facebook is already well positioned to make the Metaverse available to friends, families, and collegues alike.

### Shop
- Marketplace, Shopify, Cypto/Spend

### Hang out
- Twitch, concerts, etc, NFT Art galleries

## The bottom line
In the end, everything takes time and effort. Getting to the point where I can learn new frameworks and approach problems from new angles has taken me several years to learn but with enough practice, by breaking down problems into smaller ones and isolating your thought process, you can take shortcuts!
