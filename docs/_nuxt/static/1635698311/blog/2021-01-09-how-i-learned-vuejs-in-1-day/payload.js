A short while later, all of the required dependencies were imported successfully, and I could validate the look and feel of my first page and component. I then continued looking for opportunities to componentize my website. I located any natural breaks in the HTML and found any repeating sections to be ideal for the creation of new components. Being familiar with programming concepts, I researched every potential operation such as "},{type:b,tag:o,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"v-for"}]},{type:a,value:", "},{type:b,tag:o,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"v-bind"}]},{type:a,value:", and "},{type:b,tag:o,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"v-if"}]},{type:a,value:" to control the flow and "},{type:b,tag:e,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fvuejs.org\u002Fv2\u002Fguide\u002Fconditional.html",rel:[k,l,m],target:n},children:[{type:a,value:"dynamic behavior"}]},{type:a,value:" of my new components. Again being focused on learning Vue.js and building a static site (for now) I did not want to be learning several new concepts at once. I learned to create new methods and manage data but stuck with static data. I knew that fetching data dynamically would be fairly easy with a completed application. I found myself researching basic terms such as "},{type:b,tag:o,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"“vue component data”"}]},{type:a,value:I},{type:b,tag:o,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"“vue component methods”"}]},{type:a,value:" for which I quickly found a lot of documentation."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I started by converting one section at a time, then began drilling down into each section to find new opportunities to componentize these sections.

Using nested imports, I rebuilt sections one at a time."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"With a completed index page, I then focused on routing.
